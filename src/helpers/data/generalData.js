      We offer language courses for Japanese and English languages, taught in
      English or Romanian for Japanese courses and Japanese for English courses.
      Our courses are available for both individual and group lessons, with two
      options for class frequency: intensive courses twice a week or standard
      courses once a week. Each class runs for one and a half hours.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our intensive courses are ideal for those who want to progress quickly,
      while our standard courses offer a more relaxed pace of learning. Whether
      you are a beginner or looking to improve your existing language skills,
      our courses are suitable for all levels.
